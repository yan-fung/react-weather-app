# 🌞 🌧️ 🌀 React Weather Forecasting App

The weather forecasting application built with React and JSX.
- Users are able to see the name and country of the city the forecast is for.
- Users are able to see a summary of each day of the forecast, including the date, general description of the weather that day, and maximum temperature.
- Users are able to click on one of the summaries to view all of the forecasted information for that date.

This project is part of my bootcamp course at [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.co/).

## Quick Start and Commands

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yan-fung/react-technical-test.git
```

2. To install the package locally:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server for the app.

```bash
npm start
```

4. To test the codes in tests folder. 

```bash
npm test
```

## Technology
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and [React Testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) are used for testing purposes.
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used to perform HTTP requests for retrieving data from the API
- [PropTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) is used for validating props.

## How To Use
- The app is showing the weather forecast for Manchester by default. 
- Enter the name of a UK location to get the forecast. 
- The app can only search for locations in the UK at the moment. 

## Improvements & Further Development
If I would have more time, I would like to add the following features and to my application:
- Making the application more repsonsive to different sizes of device.
- Allowing users to check the weather in different cities outside of the UK.
- Changing the UI design to make it more appealing and user-friendly.
